    "Built at Cal Hacks 12.0 in San Francisco with Andy Nguyen, Athanasios Tassiadamis, and Yash Mulimani, we balanced Golden Gate views with competing and spotty WiFi. I led the React + D3.js frontend (Vite, Tailwind, shadcn/ui) and contributed to the FastAPI backend.",
    "After the data pipeline landed, I pushed to 6 AM to finish the frontend and backend integration. The result is an interactive D3.js graph powered by AI-assisted entity classification (Anthropic Claude) and real, web scraped congressional data."
