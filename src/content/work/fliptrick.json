    "FlipTrick is a motion-based iOS game designed to turn everyday phone movements into a fun, competitive experience. Flip, spin, and rotate their phone to perform tricks, earning real-time scores with a combo/multiplier system for chaining unique moves.",
    "The game offers 'Endless Mode' for continuous play and 'Timed Mode' for a high-score race. It features move and score history tracking, a score decay mechanism for inactivity, and an in-app tutorial. Built with Swift, UIKit, and CoreMotion, FlipTrick was developed as the final project for CodePath's Intro to iOS Course, focusing on creating a quick, active, and engaging game."
